# psimgen
A PowerShell script to generate (Inkscape) multiple image files from a single svg

# Why
Developing for mobile is always a pain regarding images. There are sizes for Android, for IOs, for Windows, for the Web and so on. For any particular image/icon you must generate 6 versions for Android, 3 for IOs, and so on... 

You you are not part of a big team you'll have to do it by hand as I did.

# What
So I've created this script for that job, nothing fancy (its really my first powershell script) and decided to share it, so here it is, free of charge, no strings (licence) attached for everybody to use, at your own risk.

It supports itself in Inkscape, this amaizing opensource project at https://inkscape.org. Honestly guys, fantastic job!!

__NOTE: You should change the script to point to your current installation of Inkscape__

If you can make it better, just let me know.
